For our objects to look more realistic we really need to texture them, but what is texture mapping ?<br>
Think if it as a way of adding extra details to an object. For example... You design an ordinary white cube, doesn't look much does it ?</p>
<p>
But add a texturemap to it, and suddenly you have a BORG cube !.<br>
Textures are bitmap pictures that have been designed with a paint program (that can save BMP format files.)</p>
<p>
Another example... If you designed a basic model of a creature, using a texturemap you could add all the external features - such as clothes and facial expressions.</p>
<p>
Although B3D has alot of commands to manage multiple textures and special effects, for now we shall just be using the very basic EntityTexture command.<br>

Of course we could save ourselves alot of time by designing our objects and applying the textures to them directly from a 3d modelling program, but that would make this tutorial a waste of time !.<br><br>

So why would we want to apply a texture in realtime ?, well for starters a new texture may be put onto the object at any time. Take a wall, shoot it ! - now for things to look realistic in our 3d world, we would like to have somekind of indication that it was shot. We could do this by loading a texture of a bullet hole directly onto the wall. Every 3d game currently on the market uses texture trickery in some form or another, as your experience grows - so will your imagination !. Why have a flat river, when you could use texturemaps to give the impression of ripples or waves.</p>

<p>B3D has so many lovely features for us to use including the new ANIMATED textures command, we will be using this later on !. (Quake I/II/III used this trick to give us the impression of moving water)</p>

<p>Let's look at this in practice:</p>

<table border="1" width="86%" bordercolor="#FFFFFF">
  <tr>
    <td width="14%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="72%" bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;<br>

      <br>
      &nbsp; Wend<br>

As you can see, a texture can make all the difference to a very basic object.</p>
<p>
The only 2 lines of code we don't already know are:
</p>




<table border="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#6097C9">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
<b>
texture=LoadTexture(&quot;blitztexture.bmp&quot;)<br>
EntityTexture cube,texture</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Two nice and friendly commands, the first loads a texturemap into memory - with the pointer variable 'texture' pointing to it.<br><br>

Once we have successfully loaded the texture, we assign it to the object using the <b>EntityTexture</b> command. (here we are assigning the variable pointer TEXTURE to the cube we defined earlier)<br><br>

You could if you wanted load the picture file <b>BLITZTEXTURE.BMP</b> into MS Paint and make some changes.. if you wanted to !<br><br>

And that's all there is to it, but a quick word of advice: If your object isn't textured as it should, always check that the texturemaps are in the right directory. It's all to easy to spend half the day trying to work out a texturing problem, only to find that you moved the program to another directory without dragging the associated texture files with it.
