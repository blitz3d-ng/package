If you've already read the section on Meshes beforehand then hopefully you'll
know most of what we will be doing already in this tutorial, if not - go away
and read it first !.</p>

<p>
let's recap:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each <b>MESH</b> (a 3d object), is made up of SURFACES.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Each <b>SURFACE</b> has a BRUSH.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Each <b>BRUSH</b> can be assigned 8 different texturemaps.<br>
    (which can be overlaid on each other to create new effects)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Each SURFACE is made up of TRIANGLES.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Each <b>TRIANGLE</b> is made up of 3 VERTEXES.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, armed with that info - you should know what makes a 3d object tick !.
Lets take a flat square as an example, it is made up of 4 vertexes and 2
triangles. What we are planning of doing is to take 2 of those vertexes and
change their coordinates.<br>
</p>
<p>Infact as mentioned in the Introduction to Meshes, we can even change the
colour of the vertexes in realtime too. Run the example - what you can hopefully
see is a square object (which is slowly spinning on the Z plane), being pulled
out of shape in 2 corners - while every-so-often the colours change.</p>
<p>It's a very easy effect to create, I wont go into great detail about how/why
the program works - but here's a quick rundown if your interested:</p>
<p>We setup the variable 'COUNTER', which does exactly that.. to be used as a
counter. Every time the program runs through its main loop, it is incremented.
Based on what value the counter is equal to, corresponds to what direction we
should pull the vertexes. If the counter reaches 1000 then change the colour of
each vertex to a random selection, before resetting the counter value.</p>
<p>Let's take a look:</p>

<p>
So how do we get at the vertexes of the object ?</p>
<p>
Well for starters we load the object with the LoadMesh command, the object we
are loading is of course called Plane.3ds.</p>


<table border="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#6097C9">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">

<b>EntityFX plane,2</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Now here's a new command we haven't seen before !, this command is really
more of mode switch than anything else. But setting values we can access the
entity in different ways. the mode value '2' is to able vertex colouring on the
whole entity, by default this is turned off.</p>
<p>Here's those mode settings:</p>



<table border="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFF00">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">

<i>1 = Full-Bright<br>
2 = Use Vertex Colours<br>
4 = Flatshading<br>
8 = Disable Fog</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>There is another command very similar to EntitiyFX called BRUSHFX. This uses
the same mode settings, but instead of changing the whole entity will work on a
single brush. (remember a mesh has surfaces, with brushes applied to them)</p>



<table border="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#6097C9">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">

<b>surface=GetSurface(plane,CountSurfaces(plane))</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
In order to get at the vertexes we must first unlock them, we do this by
creating a pointer variable that holds the memory address to the surfaces on the
mesh.</p>
<p>
Calm down !, we don't have to get our hands dirty calling with lots of nasty math's
- instead we just use the GETSURFACE command, which likes us to pass firstly the
mesh name - and secondly the amount of surfaces it has. As you can see I've
cheated and used the COUNTSURFACES command to do this for me.</p>



<table border="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#6097C9">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">

<b>VertexColor surface,0,255,0,0<br>
VertexColor surface,1,0,255,0<br>
VertexColor surface,2,0,0,255<br>
VertexColor surface,3,255,0,255</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Before going into the main loop, I've set the colour of each vertex to a
different colour. This gives us a nice rainbow effect !. As you can see we pass
the pointer variable SURFACE to the VERTEXCOLOR command, as well as the vertex
number (0-3, since our object only has 4 points) - followed by the colour values
for the Red, Green and Blue shades. (must be in the range of 0 (Dark) through to
255 (Light))</p>



<table border="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#6097C9">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">

<b>xx#=VertexX(surface,0)<br>
yy#=VertexY(surface,0)<br>
zz#=VertexZ(surface,0)</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Since I want the coordinates of the mesh to change all the time, I cant set
it with a value that doesn't change. Every update I've got to get the current
coordinates and slightly update them (by adding an offset to the X and Y coords).</p>
<p>I do this by firstly, getting the current X,Y and Z vertex coords - using the
various get vertex commands.</p>
<p>VertexX(surface,0) - gives us access to the X coordinate of the object
surface, at vertex 0.</p>
<p>Just as, VertexY(surface,99) - would give us access to the Y coodinate of
vertex 99 !!!.</p>


<table border="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#6097C9">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">

<b>VertexCoords surface,0,xx+x1,yy+y1,zz</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
As you've probably worked out by now, this is the main instruction for changing
the actual Vertex positions. It needs to be called with the Surface pointer
value, followed by the new values for the X, Y and Z positions.</p>
<p>
And that's all there is to it !!</p>
<p>
But why would you want to change the coordinates ?</p>
<p>
All games will alter their objects, its just a case of working out how, and
where they do it. Imagine you've just written a driving simulation.. wouldn't it
be nice when you crash the car to reflect the damage ?. Perhaps crumple that
fender.. or crack that window.</p>
<p>
Just like a certain other car game currently in the charts, they use exactly the
same method. You gotta hand it to B3D - You want it.. it's there, now go and use it wisely !.</p>
