<h2 id="first">My First Program</h2>

<p>After sampling some of the fine example programs included in the BlitzBasic package you are hopefully itching to try some of your own code.</p>

<p>BlitzBasic is intended as both a friendly introduction to programming computers as well as a language capable of producing polished video game software.</p>

<p>First up, the traditonal hello world program. A simple one line program that prints the message &quot;hello world&quot; on the screen. Select the File-New menu option and enter the following text:</p>

<code>
<pre>
Print "Hello World!"
</pre>
</code>


<p>If you press the F5 key to compile and run and a message greeting the world appears then congratulations! You have just authored your first BlitzBasic program.</p>

<p>The following code illustrates prompting the user of your program for some input.</p>

<code>
<pre>
a=Input("enter a number:")
Print "the value of a is "+a
</pre>
</code>

<p>Note: see how we add text and an
integer variable together to print them both on the same line.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="variables">Variables</h4>

<p>Variables in Blitz are used to
store integers, floats and strings.</p>

<p>The first time a float or a string
variable is used in your program it must be denoted with # or $
symbols .</p>

<p>If the &quot;a=&quot; in the
program is changed to &quot;a$=&quot; Blitz will treat a as a
string variable which can then contain any text the user enters
instead of the integer number it originally converted the user's
reply into.</p>

<code>
<pre>
a$=Input("enter a number:")
Print "the value of a is "+a
</pre>
</code>

<p>Suggestion: change the &quot;a$=&quot;
to &quot;a#=&quot; and enter the number 22.95. What's going on?</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="firstgame">My First Game</h2>

<p>The following program gives the
user 5 turns to guess the random number.</p>

<code>
<pre>
; guessing game
turnsleft=5

sheep=Rnd(20)

While (turnsleft>0)

    turnsleft=turnsleft-1

    guess=Input("guess how many sheep I have in my room:")

    If guess&lt;sheep Then Print "more than that!"

    If guess&gt;sheep Then Print "oh, not that many!"

    If guess=sheep Then Exit

Wend

If turnsleft=0 Then Print "game over dude" Else Print "good guess!"
</pre>
</code>

<p>There are three variables used in
this program: turnsleft, sheep and guess.</p>

<p>To begin with, turnsleft is set to
5 and sheep is set to a random number between 0 and 20. The
program then enters a &quot;while&quot; loop asking the player to
guess a number, and comparing their answer which is placed in the
variable guess with the value in sheep.</p>

<p>After playing the game a few times,
you may notice that the number of sheep does not vary much. Try
adding the following line to the top of the program to &quot;seed&quot;
the random number generator using the time of day in milliseconds.</p>

<code>
<pre>
SeedRnd MilliSecs()
</pre>
</code>

<p>Congratulations, you have just
doubled the playability of the game with one line of code!</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="gettinggraphic">Getting Graphic</h4>

<p>BlitzBasic is not designed for
building text based application such as our initial guessing game.
It is also not designed for building applications featuring
friendly graphics user interfaces filled with windows and sliders.</p>

<p>The only thing BlitzBasic has been
designed for is the very serious business of video game
development.</p>

<p>The following program initializes a
640x480 video display then plots points at random positions until
the user presses the escape key.</p>

<code>
<pre>
; getting graphic
Graphics 640,480

While Not KeyDown(1)
    Plot Rnd(640),Rnd(480)
Wend
</pre>
</code>

<p>Once again we rely on the random
number generator to provide an interesting result. Try adding the
following color command before the plot statement to vary the
color of the dots.</p>

<code>
<pre>
Color Rnd(256),Rnd(256),Rnd(256)
</pre>
</code>

<p>Although this may seem like a
simple program, creating a DirectX display such as featured here
using traditional methods can be a complex task. BlitzBasic makes
it so easy!</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="doublebuffering">Double Buffering</h2>

<p>The following code illustrates the
typical &quot;main loop&quot; of a game. For a video game to
display smoothly animated graphics it must use a technique called
&quot;Double Buffering&quot;.</p>

<p>The following program shows one
frame (the FrontBuffer) while drawing to another frame (the
BackBuffer).</p>

<code>
<pre>
; double buffering
Graphics 640,480

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

While Not KeyDown(1)
    Flip

    Cls

    Line 320,240,320+100*Cos(a),240+100*Sin(a)

    a=a+1
Wend
</pre>
</code>

<p>In BlitzBasic the <kbd>Flip</kbd> command
performs the double buffering by swapping the back and front
buffers. The <kbd>Cls</kbd> command clears the screen and the <kbd>Line</kbd> command draws a line.</p>

<p>Note: the flip command also
synchronizes to the video refresh which on standard VGA monitors
is 60 frames per second. </p>

<p>The program draws a line from the
center of the screen (320,240) at an angle of a degrees, 100
pixels long.</p>

<p>Try changing the program to add 6
to the value of a. If the frame rate of your monitor is 60 frames
per second, and a is incrementing by 6 each frame, in theory it
should increment by 360 every second which is equivalent to a
complete rotation in the world of degrees.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="mysecondgame">My Second Game</h2>

<p>The following introduces the basic
skeleton of a simple video game. </p>

<p>The status variable contains the
&quot;state&quot; of the game, which is either displaying a title
page or allowing the player to steer round the screen. Extra
states such as player dies with cosmic explosion and gameover
screen would be added to extend the game further.</p>

<p>Reading through the program, the
display is initialized in a similar manned to the previous
example using the Graphics and SetBuffer commands. The main loop,
then uses the Flip command to perform the double buffering (allowing
us to draw to one screen while the other is displayed) and then
either prints a message informing the user to press Enter to
start or calls the UpdatePlayer() function.</p>


<code>
<pre>
; eat the dots
Graphics 640,480

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

Global status=0,x#=0,y#=0,speed#=1,dir=1

; main loop
While Not KeyHit(1)
    ; refresh screen

    Flip

    Cls

    Color 255,255,0

    Rect 0,0,640,480,0

    ; select state

    Select status

    Case 0

        Locate 100,100

        Print "Press Enter To Start"

        If KeyHit(28) InitGame()

    Case 1

        UpdatePlayer()

    End Select

Wend
</pre>
</code>

<p>What UpdatePlayer() function you
ask? And if the user presses Enter what's this InitGame()
function?</p>

<p>Unlike traditional BASIC languages
where we would implement these functions as subroutines and call
them with the Gosub command BlitzBasic features user defined
functions. </p>

<p>Add the following two functions at
the bottom of the above program to allow the program to run.</p>

<p>The first function initializes the
variables we will need inorder to steer the players rectangle
around the screen. Note how these variables have been declared at
the top of the program as Global which allows us to access them
from inside functions such as InitGame().</p>

<code>
<pre>
Function InitGame()
    x=320

    y=240

    speed=1

    dir=1

    status=1

End Function
</pre>
</code>

<p>This second function changes the
players direction depending on the arrow key they are pressing or
the direction of the joystick. The code then moves the players
position (x,y) depending on the dir variable which corresponds to
up, right, down and left respectively.</p>

<code>
<pre>
Function UpdatePlayer()
    ; steer player
    If KeyDown(200) Or JoyY()&lt;-0.5 dir=0
    If KeyDown(205) Or JoyX()>0.5 dir=1
    If KeyDown(208) Or JoyY()>0.5 dir=2
    If KeyDown(203) Or JoyX()&lt;-0.5 dir=3

    ; move player
    Select dir
    Case 0 y=y-speed
    Case 1 x=x+speed
    Case 2 y=y+speed
    Case 3 x=x-speed
    End Select

    ; draw player
    Color 255,255,255
    Rect x,y,10,10
End Function
</pre>
</code>

<p>After adding the InitGame() and UpdatePlayer() code the game should run.</p>

<p>Next it's time to add some deadly rocks and some yummy food. </p>

<p>In order to do this we create some new Types that will hold all the information we need for each rock and food. To begin with these Types will simply hold the x and y position of each rock and food element we create for our game.</p>

<p>Place the following Type
declarations at the top of the program.</p>

<code>
<pre>
Type food
    Field x,y
End Type

Type rock
    Field x,y
End Type
</pre>
</code>

<p>The following code then needs to be added to the InitGame() function, insert it after the line that reads status=1.</p>

<p>This code creates 20 rocks that will kill the player and 20 food that will speed the player up. The New command creates a new object and also adds it to a list. We set the position of each rock and food by setting the x and y fields of each new object created using the backslash \ character to denote which field.</p>

<code>
<pre>
For i=0 To 20
    r.rock=New rock
    r\x=Rnd(640)
    r\y=Rnd(480)
Next

For i=0 To 20
    f.food=New food
    f\x=Rnd(640)
    f\y=Rnd(480)
Next
</pre>
</code>

<p>We now need a function that draws all the food and rocks each frame and checks if the player has collided with any.</p>

<p>Note how we can loop through each food and rock element that exist using the For..Each command pair. This is another great feature of BlitzBasic that keeps programs simple and easy to read.</p>

<p>We use the RectsOverlap command to check of the players position (x,y) collides with each food or rock element (f \ x , f \ y) or (r \ x , r \ y). If the player collides with some food we delete that piece of food and increase the player's speed. If the player collides with a rock we end the game by resetting the status variable.</p>

<code>
<pre>
Function UpdateRocksandFood()
    ; draw food and check if eaten
    Color 0,255,0

    For f.food=Each food
        Rect f\x,f\y,10,10

        If RectsOverlap(x,y,10,10,f\x,f\y,10,10)
            speed=speed+0.2

            Delete f
        EndIf
    Next

    ; draw rocks and check for roadkill
    Color 255,0,255

    For r.rock=Each rock
        Rect r\x,r\y,10,10

        If RectsOverlap(x,y,10,10,r\x,r\y,10,10)
          status=0
        EndIf
    Next
End Function
</pre>
</code>

<p>Oops, one last thing, don't forget
to call the UpdateRocksandFood() function from the main loop,
just after the UpdatePlayer() call should do nicely.</p>

<code>
<pre>
UpdateRocksandFood()
</pre>
</code>

<p>OK, after playing the game, a few things should become evident.</p>

<p>First, the player should die if they hit the outer wall. We could do this by checking if their position does not collide with the main screen rectangle (0,0,640,480). Try adding the following code to the UpdatePlayer function.</p>

<code>
<pre>
If Not RectsOverlap(x,y,10,10,0,0,630,470) status=0
</pre>
</code>

<p>Secondly, each time the game starts more rocks and food appear. This is because we never delete the food and rocks remaining from the last game. Insert the following code <strong>before</strong> the code that creates the new food and rocks in the InitGame() function.</p>

<code>
<pre>
For f.food=Each food
    Delete f
Next
For r.rock=Each rock
    Delete r
Next
</pre>
</code>
