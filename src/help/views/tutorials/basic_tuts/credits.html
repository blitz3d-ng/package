<center><h1>The Credits</h1></center><br>
<center>Blitz was lovingly written by <b>Mark Sibly</b><br>Coded with lots of help and abuse from James L Boyd, Claire Foley and George Bray. <br><br>
This tutorial was hand crafted by <b>George Bray</b> <br>Written whilst listening to Jean Michel Jarre, Pink Floyd, Vangelis and drinking
an endless supply of Tetley tea.<br><br>
I would like to thank all the beta testers who have helped through the many
stages of Blitz Basic and to those I still speak to regularly, I don't want to praise individuals as
the whole project has been very much a team effort (<b>but you know who you are</b>)<br><br><br>
Log-on to the live one here<a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com">&nbsp;Blitz Basic&nbsp;</a>and<a href="http://users.breathemail.net/georgebray">&nbsp;Here&nbsp;</a><br><br>
So long and thanks for all the fish - <a href="mailto:georgebray@breathemail.net">George</a><br><br>
