<center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>
<p align="left">Welcome to Blitz Basic -
probably the most powerful BASIC language in the Universe. You are in safe hands as Blitz was written by gamers for gamers who have an impressive track record in this field.
Within the Blitz environment you have
the power of your PC at your fingertips making video game creation fun and easy - The only limit is your imagination and creative energy.
<br><br>Blitz Basic is a hybrid of BASIC that some of you may have
used before on computers such as BBC, Spectrum & Commodore 64
and the original Amiga Blitz Basic but it requires no previous programming knowledge and this manual has been written assuming that you
no computer programming experience as it will guide you
through the various stages - starting from the very beginning in the guise of the notorious 'Hello World'. Blitz Basic is very easy
to use and represents state of the art graphics and sound - with its easy to
use library of commands you'll be creating your own games in no time at all. The aim here is to make the whole process painless - so sit back and enjoy....<br><br>
Please bear in mind at all times that programming is a gradual learning
curve and once certain goals are achieved you will be programming games for fun and hopefully for profit in no time.
Who knows - You could be sending your game to a software house for evaluation as the games you create can be saved as a stand alone executable file (EXE) we'd love to see your
games, so send them to Guildhall for evaluation and if they are commercially viable then
we could be publishing your game....So what are you waiting for? Get coding...

more effort you put into Blitz Basic the bigger the rewards will be.
