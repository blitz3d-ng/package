<% title 'Comments - Language Reference' %>
<h1>Comments</h1>

<p>You add comments to your programs using the <kbd>;</kbd> character. Everything following
the <kbd>;</kbd> until the end of the line will be ignored, this is useful for commenting
your code - so you can always look through and follow each line in a logical
manner. </p>
<p>The following code shows comments in use:</p>

<code>
<pre>
; Begin the Redraw Function
Function Redraw()
    ...
End Function
</pre>
</code>

<p>This code also shows a legal use of comments:</p>
<code>
<pre>
Function Redraw() ; Begin the Redraw Function
    ...
End Function
</pre>
</code>
