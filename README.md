This project is an attempt to revive & modernize Blitz3D by adding cross-platform & 64-bit support.

So far, we've made huge strides in making this happen. Some of the basic samples (such as [castle](_release/samples/mak/castle), [driver](_release/samples/driver), and [tron](_release/samples/mak/tron)) can run on macOS (64 bit!) with little-to-no modifications.

This is achieved by translating Blitz source into C code.

(Note: The Windows build still uses the original Blitz code generation.)

## Download

You can get the latest Windows build directly from our [CI tool](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/kfprimm/blitz3d-ng-gj3xh/artifacts/release.zip?branch=master&job=Environment:%20TOOLSET=vs2019;%20Configuration:%20release;%20Platform:%20win32). This build includes Direct3D 7 & OpenGL runtimes, without DirectPlay.

If you're looking to customize your build further or interested in macOS or Linux, please see the next section.

## Support

If you need help with anything, please ask on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/E6kTHXn).

For bug reports & feature requests, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/blitz3d-ng/blitz3d-ng/issues).

## Building

To keep the project simple to build, all 3rd-party dependencies are included in the repo or linked as submodules.

### Prerequisites (All platforms)

You'll need [cmake (3.16+)](https://cmake.org/download/) and a [ruby 3.0.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) install.

We use these tools to generate the appropriate build files per-platform as well as documentation.

### Windows

Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). Be sure to install the MFC components.

Open up a command prompt via `Start -> Visual Studio 2019 -> Developer Command Prompt for VS2019`.

```
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/blitz3d-ng/blitz3d-ng
> cd blitz3d-ng
> make release win32
> make release win64
```

### macOS

Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [brew](http://brew.sh/).

```bash
$ brew install cmake wxmac
$ bundle
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/blitz3d-ng/blitz3d-ng
$ cd blitz3d-ng
$ bin/blitz3d config && make ENV=release
```

### Linux

Setup will vary across distributions, but here is an example for Ubuntu.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential autoconf libtool gettext autopoint gperf cmake clang libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev uuid-dev libfontconfig1-dev
$ bundle
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/blitz3d-ng/blitz3d-ng
$ cd blitz3d-ng
$ bin/blitz3d config && make ENV=release
```

Alternatively, you can build everything with [docker](https://docker.io).

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/blitz3d-ng/blitz3d-ng
$ cd blitz3d-ng
$ docker build -t blitz3d - < Dockerfile
$ docker run -t -i -v `pwd`:/blitz3d-ng blitz3d make ENV=${ENV} PLATFORM=linux
```

## Documentation

The original Blitz3D help is available in the [\_release/help](_release/help) directory in HTML form. We've started replacing it with a Markdown based system.

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bin/blitz3d help --build
```

## Roadmap

- Add misc. quick fixes & improvements (i.e., add "missing" features like [BlitzClose](http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=832).)
- Improve help files & styling.
- Swap out FMOD for something with a more permissive license.
- Integrate [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org/) so that we don't depend on the DirectX X library anymore.
- OpenGL & newer Direct3D renderers.
- 64-bit support.
- macOS, Linux, Android, iOS support.
